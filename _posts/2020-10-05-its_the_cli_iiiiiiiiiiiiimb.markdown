Me at the THOUGHT of completing my very first portfolio project :

At first glance, it seemed like such a daunting task. 


The first chance I have to really prove myself, to put the skills I've built up to this point, to the ultimate test. Not just another codealong or lab.


This was it!


But I soon found I wasn't alone in my feelings and journey. Many of my classmates were feeling the same! 


I knew I just needed a quick pick me up before I started, so I grabbed a latte from Dunkin, made it back home, opened my laptop, and put on an inspirational music playlist. 


I started mapping out my program. 

Who is my user? 

How will they experience my program? 

Will it run slow? If so, how could I potentially refactor to make it faster. 

Will I use a scraper, or an API. Hmmm.... let's see... API! ABSOLUTELY. 

What are some of the best API's to use? 

Where can I find an API? 

Where can I find an open-source API that doesn't require authorization. 

... 


All of these questions floating around in my mind, keying me up, causing me to just stop and stare at the screen.  I felt stuck once again.
