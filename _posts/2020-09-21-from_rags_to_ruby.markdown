"How did I get here?"



Is a question I would often ask myself in my previous life as a buyer within the electrical construction industry. 


Most of my days would consist of monotonous tasks such as procuring basic and specialized electrical materials, safety gear and consumables, and wiping down the office kitchen with recycled old tshirt rags. 


On other days, emergencies would arise in the field that would demand my immediate attention and expertise with quickly sourcing oddball products and equipment that are not commonly found in stock with vendors. 


By the end of most days, I had run out of gas... my brain was mush, and body was drained. 


All I had energy to do after a hard day's work was to watch my favorite tv show and go to bed, often left feeling unfulfilled and apathetic.

Let's be clear. 

Although I became skilled at this profession, this was just a job. An industry I never intended to enter. It was not glamorous. It was not saving the world. Although I did find some value in what I was doing, I was not passionate and often felt as though my talents were being wasted. I could feel my soul slowly eroding away and after ten years, I had burned out.

Always in the back of my mind, I thought, I need to contribute to something more meaningful. To make a positive impact in the world. To be passionately engrossed in what I was doing, as we spend a majority of our life sleeping and working.

The idea of software engineeing was not an overnight interest. It was certainly a slow roll over many years. 


My journey began back in high school when Myspace was at the height of its popularity and became all the rage of amateur html coding enthusiasts. 


Decking out your page with cool pics, gifs, questionaires, lists, and formatting was the ultimate way to represent who you were as an individual and make your mark on the world.

No too long after, I began college right about the time Facebook was becoming the new social media norm. While my days soon became filled with studying biology and various unrelated subjects, keeping up with my Myspace page (let alone learning to program)  fell by the wayside. My coding days were put to a halt.  



Fast forward many moons later . . .

Learning to code was something I knew I would eventually revisit. But at this point in my life, it seemed almost unattainable. I often would work 60+ hours a week. I "never had the time"  to go back to school. Then 2020 happened, a year that will live in infamy. During the time the first coronavirus tidal wave struck the US, 

I was laid off.

Like many others in my same boat, I was mentally and emotionally processing being abruptly let go from a company I had been with for years and scrambling to figure out what my next move would be. Getting my finances in order, researching jobs within my network, as well as planning the logistics of moving my entire life to another city (I was in company housing at the time), were all part of my new normal. 



One day when I was left with nothing else to fill my time, I started scrolling through instagram and stumbled upon an ad for a coding bootcamp. After skimming through I became both intrigued and skeptical. So I did my due dilligence and started a deep dive of research into all of the bootcamps I could find.



During that time, something within my mind just "clicked". What better time to invest in my future than now? This could be my opportunity to start fresh. Step into a career I found to be thrilling and worthwhile for so many different reasons.



So here I am. I'm doing this!


Continuing my adventure, set in this new era of my life. Excited for what the future holds.
